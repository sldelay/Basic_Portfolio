                    Hello, thank you for taking the time to learn about me! In 2012, I started my journey in the coffee
                    industry. I have spent the past seven years becoming an expert in all things coffee. I am now a
                    part-owner at a coffee shop called Union Coffee Company, based in Milford, New Hampshire.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I currently live in Milford, New Hampshire with my wife and two daughters. In my free time, which is
                    limited, I really enjoy woodworking and exploring new places.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have had a lot of fun spending all of my career so far in the coffee world, but I have decided to
                    make a career
                    move. In December of 2019, I started a full stack web development bootcamp with UNH in Portsmouth,
                    New
                    Hampshire. My goal is to lay down a strong foundation in my knowledge and skillset as a developer
                    and
                    hopefully find a job in the field!
