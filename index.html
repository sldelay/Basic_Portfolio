                Hello, thank you for taking the time to learn about me! In 2012, I started my journey in the coffee
                industry. I have spent the past seven years becoming an expert in all things coffee. I now am a
                part-owner in a coffee shop called Union Coffee Company, based in Milford, New Hampshire.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I currently live in Milford, New Hampshire with my wife and two daughters. In my free time (which is
                limited) I really enjoy woodworking and exploring new places.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have had a lot of fun spending all of my time in the coffee world, but I have decided to make a career
                move. In December of 2019, I started a full stack web development bootcamp with UNH in Portsmouth, New
                Hampshire. My goal is to lay down a strong foundation in my knowledge and skills as a developer and
                hopefully find a job in the field!
